2
00:00:40,877 --> 00:00:42,003
What have you done?

3
00:00:51,429 --> 00:00:53,515
What have you done?

4
00:01:30,301 --> 00:01:31,301
All done.

5
00:01:32,804 --> 00:01:34,472
Not so bad, was it?

6
00:01:35,724 --> 00:01:36,724
See?

7
00:01:37,726 --> 00:01:39,477
There's nothing to be afraid of.

8
00:01:40,061 --> 00:01:41,354
Is there, Nancy?

9
00:01:44,941 --> 00:01:46,860
Why don't you take a seat?

10
00:01:49,863 --> 00:01:51,656
No!

11
00:01:59,664 --> 00:02:01,416
Nancy, just stay with
me. Stay with me, okay?

12
00:02:01,499 --> 00:02:03,293
Whatever you guys are doing, hurry up!

13
00:02:04,961 --> 00:02:07,005
Steve says you need to hurry!

14
00:02:07,088 --> 00:02:09,591
- Yeah? No shit!
- We're trying. We can't find anything.

15
00:02:09,674 --> 00:02:12,427
- What is all this shit?
- What are you even looking for?

16
00:02:12,510 --> 00:02:15,889
Madonna, Blondie, Bowie,
Beatles? Music! We need music!

17
00:02:15,972 --> 00:02:18,058
This is music!

18
00:02:25,607 --> 00:02:26,816
Son of a...

19
00:02:29,569 --> 00:02:30,569
God!

20
00:02:31,071 --> 00:02:32,113
Nancy.

21
00:02:38,119 --> 00:02:39,662
What are you doing?

22
00:02:41,539 --> 00:02:43,875
It's not time for you to leave.

23
00:02:51,257 --> 00:02:54,427
Now that you've seen where I've been...

24
00:02:56,054 --> 00:03:00,141
... I would like very much to show you

25
00:03:00,225 --> 00:03:02,393
where I am going.

26
00:03:10,401 --> 00:03:13,780
Take a seat, Nancy.

27
00:03:56,656 --> 00:03:57,656
I...

28
00:03:58,449 --> 00:04:00,326
want you to tell

29
00:04:01,202 --> 00:04:02,453
Eleven.

30
00:04:04,706 --> 00:04:06,791
I want you to tell her

31
00:04:07,584 --> 00:04:10,211
everything you see.

32
00:04:15,592 --> 00:04:16,759
No!

33
00:04:18,011 --> 00:04:19,011
No!

34
00:04:20,638 --> 00:04:22,807
- Tell her...
- No!

35
00:04:24,058 --> 00:04:25,310
... everything.

36
00:04:26,811 --> 00:04:27,854
No!

37
00:04:28,980 --> 00:04:30,607
Hey, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa.

38
00:04:30,690 --> 00:04:33,276
It's okay. It's okay. It's okay.

39
00:04:34,485 --> 00:04:36,404
It's okay. I'm here.

40
00:04:36,487 --> 00:04:38,531
I'm right here.

41
00:06:04,701 --> 00:06:06,119
What's going on there?

42
00:06:06,202 --> 00:06:08,538
Get the power back on!

43
00:06:10,873 --> 00:06:13,167
Tell him that the
prisoners are contained...

44
00:06:13,251 --> 00:06:15,795
and that you're working on the power.

45
00:06:16,838 --> 00:06:17,922
Tell him!

46
00:06:18,006 --> 00:06:19,882
And that door there, where does it lead?

47
00:06:19,966 --> 00:06:21,092
To... to cell block two...

48
00:06:21,592 --> 00:06:23,136
No cell blocks!

49
00:06:23,720 --> 00:06:25,513
I need a safe way out of here.

50
00:06:33,855 --> 00:06:35,481
Guess you got my message, huh?

51
00:06:36,149 --> 00:06:40,611
Oh, no, I just have always
wanted to visit the Soviet Union.

52
00:06:41,154 --> 00:06:42,280
With Murray.

53
00:06:42,905 --> 00:06:44,032
You two getting along?

54
00:06:45,533 --> 00:06:48,494
He's the Starsky to my Hutch.

55
00:06:50,288 --> 00:06:51,497
I thought you were dead.

56
00:06:54,292 --> 00:06:55,460
Thought I lost you.

57
00:06:58,588 --> 00:07:00,214
I did lose you.

58
00:07:01,591 --> 00:07:03,301
For eight months.

59
00:07:05,970 --> 00:07:07,305
We had a funeral.

60
00:07:09,432 --> 00:07:10,641
Anybody show?

61
00:07:11,225 --> 00:07:12,226
Are you kidding?

62
00:07:13,102 --> 00:07:15,605
You're the hero of Hawkins.

63
00:07:17,648 --> 00:07:18,775
It's true.

64
00:07:20,151 --> 00:07:24,030
Yeah, I always felt I'd be
easier to like when I was dead.

65
00:07:28,284 --> 00:07:29,284
How about El?

66
00:07:29,869 --> 00:07:31,204
She's good.

67
00:07:33,956 --> 00:07:35,541
She misses her dad.

68
00:07:37,126 --> 00:07:38,294
We all do.

69
00:07:40,046 --> 00:07:41,964
Uh, I hate to interrupt,

70
00:07:42,048 --> 00:07:44,926
but apparently, they can climb too.

71
00:07:50,139 --> 00:07:52,058
Lower your weapons.

72
00:07:52,141 --> 00:07:53,726
Lower your weapons!

73
00:07:53,810 --> 00:07:56,104
Don't shoot!

74
00:08:01,734 --> 00:08:03,319
Stop!

75
00:08:08,866 --> 00:08:09,909
The hell is that?

76
00:08:09,992 --> 00:08:13,371
Please tell me they don't have
another one of those things.

77
00:08:25,466 --> 00:08:26,843
You can't go in there!

78
00:08:26,926 --> 00:08:27,927
It's dangerous!

79
00:08:29,720 --> 00:08:31,139
It's dangerous!

80
00:09:52,970 --> 00:09:54,597
Oh my God.

81
00:10:10,821 --> 00:10:12,448
The hell are they doing?

82
00:10:46,148 --> 00:10:47,233
Hey.

83
00:10:48,359 --> 00:10:49,402
Found something.

84
00:10:59,787 --> 00:11:03,207
- Think this'll lead us outta here?
- I give it a hundred to one odds.

85
00:11:19,098 --> 00:11:21,309
And one, two, three.

86
00:11:23,311 --> 00:11:25,021
And one, two, three.

87
00:11:26,230 --> 00:11:29,233
Again. One, two, three.

88
00:11:35,781 --> 00:11:37,908
Pulse is dropping.
One-fifty now. BP's 160...

89
00:11:43,456 --> 00:11:44,456
How do you feel?

90
00:11:45,458 --> 00:11:46,792
Can you hear us?

91
00:11:48,377 --> 00:11:50,212
Eleven. Can you hear us?

92
00:11:55,968 --> 00:11:57,219
No, leave her.

93
00:11:58,679 --> 00:12:00,014
Hi, Jane.

94
00:14:31,749 --> 00:14:35,169
Holy shit, dude. Check it out.

95
00:14:35,252 --> 00:14:38,297
I didn't know they expanded into Nevada.

96
00:14:40,466 --> 00:14:41,759
Watch out, Domino's.

97
00:14:42,426 --> 00:14:44,637
Your dominoes are gonna fall.

98
00:14:47,014 --> 00:14:48,390
How far is Nina from Vegas?

99
00:14:48,474 --> 00:14:49,475
From Vegas?

100
00:14:49,558 --> 00:14:52,144
Um, as long as Suzie's
coordinates are right,

101
00:14:52,228 --> 00:14:54,021
about another 90 miles. Why?

102
00:14:54,104 --> 00:14:57,566
Well, once we save her, El,
we should stop on the way back.

103
00:14:57,650 --> 00:15:01,111
El could make us, like, super
rich, and we'd never have to work.

104
00:15:01,195 --> 00:15:04,949
We could just play D&D and
Nintendo for the rest of our lives.

105
00:15:05,032 --> 00:15:06,742
Yeah. Totally.

106
00:15:10,704 --> 00:15:12,498
We're gonna make it,
Mike. She's gonna be okay.

107
00:15:12,581 --> 00:15:14,416
Yeah, I know. I... I know she is.

108
00:15:15,960 --> 00:15:18,170
But... But what if after
all this is over, she...

109
00:15:19,922 --> 00:15:21,549
sh... she doesn't need me anymore?

110
00:15:21,632 --> 00:15:23,425
No, o... of course
she'll still need you.

111
00:15:23,509 --> 00:15:25,052
She'll always need you, Mike.

112
00:15:25,135 --> 00:15:26,846
I keep telling myself that, but I...

113
00:15:28,013 --> 00:15:29,223
I don't believe it.

114
00:15:29,306 --> 00:15:31,809
I mean, she's special.

115
00:15:32,309 --> 00:15:33,394
She was born special.

116
00:15:33,477 --> 00:15:36,063
Maybe I was one of the
first people to realize that.

117
00:15:36,856 --> 00:15:39,400
But the truth is, when I
stumbled on her in the woods,

118
00:15:39,483 --> 00:15:40,901
she just needed someone.

119
00:15:40,985 --> 00:15:44,488
It's not fate. It's... It's not
destiny. It's just simple dumb luck.

120
00:15:44,572 --> 00:15:47,199
And one day she's gonna realize
I'm just some random nerd

121
00:15:47,283 --> 00:15:49,368
that got lucky that Superman
landed on his doorstep.

122
00:15:49,451 --> 00:15:51,328
I mean, at least Lois Lane

123
00:15:51,412 --> 00:15:53,831
is an ace reporter for the
Daily Planet, right? But...

124
00:15:56,166 --> 00:15:57,209
- Sorry.
- No.

125
00:15:57,293 --> 00:16:00,296
No, i... it's so stupid, given
everything that's going on.

126
00:16:00,379 --> 00:16:02,673
It's just... I... I
don't know, I just...

127
00:16:03,007 --> 00:16:04,007
Uh...

128
00:16:04,049 --> 00:16:05,551
You're scared of losing her.

129
00:16:08,387 --> 00:16:10,180
Can I show you something?

130
00:16:31,035 --> 00:16:32,119
This is amazing.

131
00:16:33,037 --> 00:16:34,079
Did you paint this?

132
00:16:34,872 --> 00:16:36,624
Yeah. Yeah. I mean...

133
00:16:36,707 --> 00:16:38,959
I mean... I mean, El asked me to.

134
00:16:39,043 --> 00:16:42,379
She commissioned it, basically.
I mean, she told me what to draw.

135
00:16:42,463 --> 00:16:44,173
Anyway, my point is,

136
00:16:45,132 --> 00:16:46,467
see how you're leading us here?

137
00:16:46,550 --> 00:16:48,761
You're guiding the whole
party, inspiring us.

138
00:16:48,844 --> 00:16:50,346
That... That's what you do.

139
00:16:50,429 --> 00:16:52,932
And see your coat of
arms here? It's a heart.

140
00:16:53,015 --> 00:16:54,475
And I know it's sort of on the nose,

141
00:16:54,558 --> 00:16:56,977
but that's what holds
this party together. Heart.

142
00:16:57,061 --> 00:17:01,065
Because, I mean, without
heart, we'd all fall apart.

143
00:17:01,690 --> 00:17:03,859
Even El. Especially El.

144
00:17:05,569 --> 00:17:10,115
These past few months, she's
been so lost without you.

145
00:17:10,199 --> 00:17:14,203
It's just, she's so different
from other people, and...

146
00:17:14,912 --> 00:17:17,873
... when you're...
when you're different,

147
00:17:17,957 --> 00:17:19,375
sometimes...

148
00:17:19,458 --> 00:17:21,919
... you feel like a mistake.

149
00:17:23,337 --> 00:17:26,090
But you make her feel like
she's not a mistake at all.

150
00:17:26,173 --> 00:17:28,092
Like she's better for being different.

151
00:17:28,175 --> 00:17:29,802
And that gives her the
courage to fight on.

152
00:17:29,885 --> 00:17:31,387
If she was mean to you

153
00:17:31,470 --> 00:17:33,639
or she seemed like she
was pushing you away,

154
00:17:33,722 --> 00:17:35,350
it's because she's scared of losing you,

155
00:17:35,351 --> 00:17:36,725
like you're scared of losing her.

156
00:17:36,809 --> 00:17:38,519
And if she was going to lose you,

157
00:17:38,602 --> 00:17:40,771
I... I think she'd rather
just get it over with quick.

158
00:17:40,854 --> 00:17:42,272
Like ripping off a Band-Aid.

159
00:17:43,607 --> 00:17:45,776
So, yeah, El needs you, Mike.

160
00:17:45,859 --> 00:17:47,361
And she always will.

161
00:17:48,946 --> 00:17:50,114
Yeah?

162
00:17:51,031 --> 00:17:52,031
Yeah.

163
00:18:54,887 --> 00:18:56,388
After the attack,

164
00:18:56,472 --> 00:18:57,765
you fell into a coma.

165
00:18:58,891 --> 00:19:02,311
Like One, you had pushed
yourself beyond your limit.

166
00:19:03,812 --> 00:19:05,773
And it very nearly destroyed you.

167
00:19:07,274 --> 00:19:09,443
But that is where your
similarities ended.

168
00:19:10,944 --> 00:19:12,654
What you displayed that day

169
00:19:13,572 --> 00:19:15,491
was beyond anything I'd ever imagined.

170
00:19:16,658 --> 00:19:18,744
A potential I'd only dreamed of.

171
00:19:24,792 --> 00:19:25,959
But when you awoke,

172
00:19:27,461 --> 00:19:28,879
something had been lost.

173
00:19:29,963 --> 00:19:31,048
Your memories,

174
00:19:31,590 --> 00:19:34,676
along with whatever else you'd
found within yourself that day.

175
00:19:35,761 --> 00:19:38,097
But I knew then, just as I knew today,

176
00:19:38,180 --> 00:19:40,182
that your powers had not been lost.

177
00:19:40,265 --> 00:19:42,935
They just needed a spark.

178
00:19:45,229 --> 00:19:46,355
But that day,

179
00:19:47,272 --> 00:19:48,941
you awakened something else.

180
00:19:49,024 --> 00:19:51,068
A doorway to another world.

181
00:19:54,780 --> 00:19:56,907
I always thought that
Henry was out there,

182
00:19:57,616 --> 00:19:59,159
hiding in the darkness.

183
00:20:00,911 --> 00:20:04,123
I didn't know for sure,
not beyond a feeling.

184
00:20:05,874 --> 00:20:06,874
Until now.

185
00:20:09,211 --> 00:20:12,923
He's claimed three victims so
far, and when I saw the eyes,

186
00:20:13,715 --> 00:20:15,509
I knew... I knew that was him.

187
00:20:16,260 --> 00:20:19,596
He was sending us a message,
letting us know he's back.

188
00:20:21,265 --> 00:20:22,891
That's when I came to see you.

189
00:20:28,856 --> 00:20:30,023
My friends.

190
00:20:30,607 --> 00:20:32,693
Well, we... we haven't risked contact,

191
00:20:32,776 --> 00:20:34,653
but, as far as we know,

192
00:20:34,736 --> 00:20:36,572
they're... they're all safe.

193
00:20:37,781 --> 00:20:39,867
But I'm not gonna lie to you, Eleven.

194
00:20:40,868 --> 00:20:42,369
Your friends are in terrible danger.

195
00:20:43,162 --> 00:20:44,872
With each victim he takes,

196
00:20:44,955 --> 00:20:45,955
Henry is...

197
00:20:47,166 --> 00:20:50,961
chiseling away at the barrier
that exists between our two worlds.

198
00:20:51,670 --> 00:20:52,671
"Chiseling"?

199
00:20:53,255 --> 00:20:54,756
Imagine, if you will,

200
00:20:54,840 --> 00:20:57,092
the barrier between our worlds is a...

201
00:20:57,926 --> 00:20:59,052
concrete dam.

202
00:21:00,679 --> 00:21:03,515
Henry is putting cracks in this dam.

203
00:21:04,850 --> 00:21:06,268
Cracks in dams

204
00:21:06,351 --> 00:21:07,519
create pressure.

205
00:21:08,520 --> 00:21:09,771
Left unchecked,

206
00:21:10,814 --> 00:21:12,274
the pressure will build.

207
00:21:12,983 --> 00:21:14,276
And build.

208
00:21:14,359 --> 00:21:16,945
And eventually, it will
reach a breaking point.

209
00:21:18,280 --> 00:21:19,573
And the dam will burst.

210
00:21:21,074 --> 00:21:22,409
And when that happens,

211
00:21:23,702 --> 00:21:24,995
Hawkins will fall.

212
00:21:31,793 --> 00:21:33,921
Well, that went very well, I thought.

213
00:21:34,004 --> 00:21:37,090
You eased her into it, nice and
gentle, just like we talked about.

214
00:21:37,174 --> 00:21:38,467
Not ominous at all.

215
00:22:20,676 --> 00:22:22,344
He showed me

216
00:22:23,136 --> 00:22:25,639
things that haven't happened yet.

217
00:22:27,349 --> 00:22:29,434
The most awful things.

218
00:22:33,063 --> 00:22:34,106
I saw

219
00:22:34,940 --> 00:22:36,441
a dark cloud

220
00:22:37,276 --> 00:22:39,027
spreading over Hawkins.

221
00:22:39,778 --> 00:22:41,613
Downtown on fire.

222
00:22:42,990 --> 00:22:44,408
Dead soldiers.

223
00:22:46,660 --> 00:22:47,660
And this...

224
00:22:49,079 --> 00:22:51,290
giant creature

225
00:22:52,082 --> 00:22:55,335
with... a gaping mouth.

226
00:22:55,419 --> 00:22:57,212
And this creature wasn't alone.

227
00:22:58,171 --> 00:23:00,340
There were so many monsters.

228
00:23:02,259 --> 00:23:03,260
An army.

229
00:23:04,761 --> 00:23:07,180
And they were coming into Hawkins.

230
00:23:08,181 --> 00:23:09,683
Into our neighborhoods.

231
00:23:11,184 --> 00:23:12,184
Our homes.

232
00:23:13,145 --> 00:23:14,145
And then...

233
00:23:16,106 --> 00:23:18,108
he showed me my mom.

234
00:23:20,068 --> 00:23:21,111
And Holly.

235
00:23:22,904 --> 00:23:23,904
Mike.

236
00:23:25,240 --> 00:23:26,240
And they...

237
00:23:28,285 --> 00:23:29,369
they were all...

238
00:23:34,666 --> 00:23:38,378
Okay, but... he's just
trying to scare you, Nance.

239
00:23:39,296 --> 00:23:40,297
Right? I mean...

240
00:23:41,590 --> 00:23:42,716
I mean, it's not real.

241
00:23:42,799 --> 00:23:43,842
Not yet.

242
00:23:46,094 --> 00:23:49,056
But there... there was something else.

243
00:23:50,515 --> 00:23:52,559
He showed me gates.

244
00:23:54,186 --> 00:23:55,729
Four gates.

245
00:23:56,897 --> 00:23:58,982
Spreading across Hawkins.

246
00:23:59,608 --> 00:24:03,779
And these gates, they looked like
the one outside of Eddie's trailer,

247
00:24:03,862 --> 00:24:06,448
but... they didn't stop growing.

248
00:24:06,531 --> 00:24:09,368
And this wasn't the Upside Down Hawkins.

249
00:24:10,160 --> 00:24:11,953
This was our Hawkins.

250
00:24:13,955 --> 00:24:14,955
Our home.

251
00:24:17,709 --> 00:24:18,919
Four chimes.

252
00:24:21,046 --> 00:24:22,046
Vecna's clock.

253
00:24:23,673 --> 00:24:25,342
It always chimes four times.

254
00:24:27,511 --> 00:24:28,511
Four exactly.

255
00:24:29,679 --> 00:24:30,806
I heard them too.

256
00:24:36,228 --> 00:24:38,355
He's been telling us
his plan this whole time.

257
00:24:39,106 --> 00:24:40,399
Four kills.

258
00:24:41,691 --> 00:24:42,901
Four gates.

259
00:24:46,696 --> 00:24:47,989
End of the world.

260
00:24:48,073 --> 00:24:49,282
If that's true...

261
00:24:51,410 --> 00:24:52,786
he's only one kill away.

262
00:24:52,869 --> 00:24:55,705
Oh Jesus Christ. Jesus Christ.

263
00:24:55,789 --> 00:24:57,165
Try 'em again. Try 'em again.

264
00:25:10,429 --> 00:25:11,888
- Anything?
- No.

265
00:25:11,972 --> 00:25:13,682
Rang a few times, then
went to busy signal.

266
00:25:13,765 --> 00:25:15,517
Maybe you punched it wrong. Try again.

267
00:25:15,600 --> 00:25:18,145
- I didn't punch it in wrong.
- Well, I don't know.

268
00:25:18,228 --> 00:25:19,980
I think she knows how to use a phone.

269
00:25:20,063 --> 00:25:22,315
I'm just saying, she
could've typed it in wrong.

270
00:25:25,735 --> 00:25:28,029
- Same shit.
- How is that possible?

271
00:25:28,113 --> 00:25:30,782
Joyce has this telemarketer
job. Always on the phone.

272
00:25:30,866 --> 00:25:32,242
Mike won't stop whining about it.

273
00:25:32,325 --> 00:25:35,704
Yeah, but this phone's been
busy for, what, three days now?

274
00:25:36,204 --> 00:25:37,289
That's not Joyce.

275
00:25:37,789 --> 00:25:39,666
No way. Something's wrong.

276
00:25:40,625 --> 00:25:41,835
She's right.

277
00:25:41,918 --> 00:25:44,671
It can't be just
coincidence. It can't be.

278
00:25:45,672 --> 00:25:49,092
Whatever's happening in Lenora
is connected to all of this.

279
00:25:49,176 --> 00:25:50,177
I'm sure of it.

280
00:25:53,054 --> 00:25:54,598
But Vecna can't hurt them.

281
00:25:56,725 --> 00:25:58,185
Not if he's dead.

282
00:25:58,268 --> 00:26:01,271
We have to go back in there.
Back to the Upside Down.

283
00:26:01,354 --> 00:26:03,106
- Whoa, no, no, no. What?
- Nope.

284
00:26:03,190 --> 00:26:05,567
- Let's think this through.
- What is there to think through?

285
00:26:05,650 --> 00:26:08,445
- We barely made it out of there.
- Yeah, because we weren't prepared.

286
00:26:08,528 --> 00:26:11,865
But this time, we will be.
We'll get weapons and protection.

287
00:26:11,948 --> 00:26:14,993
We'll go through the gate, we'll
find his lair, and we'll kill him.

288
00:26:15,076 --> 00:26:16,286
Or he'll kill us.

289
00:26:16,369 --> 00:26:19,372
The only reason you survived
is because he wanted you to.

290
00:26:19,456 --> 00:26:22,125
- He's not scared of us.
- And for good reason.

291
00:26:22,209 --> 00:26:25,378
We were wrong about Vecna. Henry. One.

292
00:26:25,462 --> 00:26:26,880
Sorry, what are we calling him now?

293
00:26:26,963 --> 00:26:28,048
- One.
- Vecna.

294
00:26:28,131 --> 00:26:29,341
- Henry.
- Right.

295
00:26:29,424 --> 00:26:31,885
We've learned something
new about Vecna/Henry/One.

296
00:26:31,968 --> 00:26:34,600
He's a number like Eleven,
only a sick, evil, male,

297
00:26:34,601 --> 00:26:36,556
child-murdering version of
her with really bad skin.

298
00:26:36,640 --> 00:26:39,267
But my... my point is,
he's super powerful.

299
00:26:39,351 --> 00:26:41,042
Could turn us inside out
with a snap of his fingers.

300
00:26:41,043 --> 00:26:42,312
It's not a fair fight.

301
00:26:42,395 --> 00:26:43,897
Then why fight fair?

302
00:26:43,980 --> 00:26:47,317
You're right. He's like Eleven.
But that gives us an upper hand.

303
00:26:47,400 --> 00:26:49,069
We know Eleven's strengths.

304
00:26:49,152 --> 00:26:51,196
And weaknesses.

305
00:26:51,279 --> 00:26:52,614
Weaknesses?

306
00:26:52,697 --> 00:26:54,157
When El remote-travels,

307
00:26:54,241 --> 00:26:57,953
she goes into this sort
of trance-like state.

308
00:26:58,036 --> 00:26:59,329
I bet the same is true of Vecna.

309
00:26:59,412 --> 00:27:01,540
That would explain what
he was doing in that attic.

310
00:27:01,623 --> 00:27:04,000
Exactly. When he
attacks his next victim,

311
00:27:04,084 --> 00:27:07,546
I'll bet you he's back in that
attic, physical body defenseless.

312
00:27:07,629 --> 00:27:09,714
Defenseless? What
about the army of bats?

313
00:27:09,798 --> 00:27:12,050
True. We'll have to
find a way past them.

314
00:27:12,133 --> 00:27:13,343
Distract them somehow.

315
00:27:13,426 --> 00:27:15,887
- And, uh, how do we do that, exactly?
- No idea.

316
00:27:15,971 --> 00:27:17,681
But once they're gone,

317
00:27:17,764 --> 00:27:19,182
he doesn't stand a chance.

318
00:27:19,266 --> 00:27:22,227
It'll be like slaying
sleeping Dracula in his coffin.

319
00:27:22,310 --> 00:27:23,895
That all sounds good in theory,

320
00:27:23,979 --> 00:27:25,981
but there is no pattern
to Vecna's killings.

321
00:27:26,064 --> 00:27:27,566
Not one that I can decipher.

322
00:27:27,649 --> 00:27:29,734
We don't know when he's
going to attack next.

323
00:27:29,818 --> 00:27:32,612
- Don't even know who he's going to attack.
- Yeah, we do.

324
00:27:33,238 --> 00:27:34,698
I can still feel him.

325
00:27:34,781 --> 00:27:37,033
I'm still marked.

326
00:27:38,368 --> 00:27:39,369
Cursed.

327
00:27:41,329 --> 00:27:42,581
I ditch Kate Bush,

328
00:27:43,498 --> 00:27:44,791
I draw his focus back to me.

329
00:27:44,874 --> 00:27:46,042
Max.

330
00:27:47,210 --> 00:27:48,210
You can't.

331
00:27:48,753 --> 00:27:50,046
He'll kill you.

332
00:27:50,630 --> 00:27:51,881
I survived before.

333
00:27:54,467 --> 00:27:55,552
I can survive again.

334
00:27:57,012 --> 00:27:59,900
I just need to keep him busy long enough

335
00:27:59,901 --> 00:28:01,474
so that you guys can
get into that attic.

336
00:28:01,558 --> 00:28:03,977
Then you can chop his head off.

337
00:28:04,769 --> 00:28:08,064
Stab him in the heart. Blow him up
with some explosive Dustin cooks up.

338
00:28:08,148 --> 00:28:11,401
I honestly don't care how you
put this asshole in his grave.

339
00:28:11,402 --> 00:28:12,402
Just...

340
00:28:14,863 --> 00:28:15,905
... whatever it is...

341
00:28:18,241 --> 00:28:19,241
whatever you do...

342
00:28:22,912 --> 00:28:23,913
try not to miss.

343
00:29:58,174 --> 00:29:59,217
Bam.

344
00:29:59,300 --> 00:30:00,300
Durak.

345
00:30:00,301 --> 00:30:01,761
Son of a bitch!

346
00:30:26,870 --> 00:30:29,080
Sayonara!

347
00:30:35,420 --> 00:30:37,088
Oh God! Oh God!

348
00:30:44,304 --> 00:30:45,972
Son of a bitch!

349
00:30:51,478 --> 00:30:53,021
- You okay? All right?
- Yeah.

350
00:30:53,104 --> 00:30:55,899
- You okay?
- Okay? I'm great! Whoo!

351
00:30:56,524 --> 00:30:58,400
Oh, nothing like a little prison escape

352
00:30:58,401 --> 00:31:00,653
to get your day started, am I right?

353
00:31:00,737 --> 00:31:02,071
We're not out of the woods yet.

354
00:31:02,155 --> 00:31:05,283
My people do not take kindly to
escapes. They'll be hunting us.

355
00:31:05,366 --> 00:31:09,037
Yeah, well, we aren't exactly
planning on sticking around.

356
00:31:09,954 --> 00:31:13,792
- Where's the plane you came in on?
- That plane? Um, that crashed.

357
00:31:15,460 --> 00:31:16,878
- Crashed?
- His fault.

358
00:31:16,961 --> 00:31:18,963
A word of warning.

359
00:31:19,047 --> 00:31:23,009
That man is more slippery
than an eel dipped in baby oil.

360
00:31:23,092 --> 00:31:24,761
I wouldn't trust a
word out of his mouth.

361
00:31:24,844 --> 00:31:27,347
My tongue. My tongue!

362
00:31:27,430 --> 00:31:28,807
I... I can't feel my tongue.

363
00:31:28,890 --> 00:31:31,518
We need to get out of
here, back to the States.

364
00:31:31,601 --> 00:31:33,770
Can you get us to another plane?

365
00:31:33,853 --> 00:31:34,853
Now?

366
00:31:34,896 --> 00:31:36,606
You're asking for Yuri's help

367
00:31:36,689 --> 00:31:39,609
after dragging him through
miles of shit tunnel?

368
00:31:39,692 --> 00:31:43,196
I could have told you we are
going wrong way hours ago.

369
00:31:43,279 --> 00:31:44,614
You Neanderthal...

370
00:31:44,697 --> 00:31:47,158
Watch your mouth, or
I am gonna take this,

371
00:31:47,242 --> 00:31:49,702
I'm gonna rub it along
the bottom of my shoe,

372
00:31:49,786 --> 00:31:53,248
and I'm gonna jam it down your throat.

373
00:31:53,331 --> 00:31:54,791
Well, go ahead!

374
00:31:54,874 --> 00:31:57,877
But then you'll never make
it out of my country alive.

375
00:31:57,961 --> 00:31:59,504
So you can get us out.

376
00:31:59,587 --> 00:32:02,423
For a glass of water and hot steam bath

377
00:32:03,258 --> 00:32:06,261
and five-inch stack of American dollars,

378
00:32:06,344 --> 00:32:09,973
Yuri will fly you to moon.

379
00:32:10,056 --> 00:32:12,725
You make another demand,
you double-crossing mudak,

380
00:32:13,601 --> 00:32:15,687
I'll decorate the roof of
this van with your brains.

381
00:32:15,770 --> 00:32:19,065
Why so angry, comrade?

382
00:32:19,148 --> 00:32:21,609
Rough couple of days for you, I'm sure.

383
00:32:22,193 --> 00:32:23,862
But now you are free.

384
00:32:23,945 --> 00:32:26,990
Everything works out.
Happy ending for everybody.

385
00:32:27,390 --> 00:32:28,408
No?

386
00:32:28,408 --> 00:32:33,621
For you, that will very much
depend on how you answer. Comrade.

387
00:32:34,205 --> 00:32:36,207
Will you take us to America?

388
00:32:36,291 --> 00:32:37,375
Yes?

389
00:32:40,737 --> 00:32:41,796
Or no?

390
00:32:50,054 --> 00:32:52,223
Check this out. The War Zone.

391
00:32:53,057 --> 00:32:55,435
I've been there once. It's huge.

392
00:32:55,435 --> 00:32:58,146
They got everything you need for, uh...

393
00:32:58,688 --> 00:33:00,648
well, killing things, basically.

394
00:33:00,732 --> 00:33:02,442
You think fake Rambo
has enough guns there?

395
00:33:02,525 --> 00:33:05,111
Is that a grenade? I mean,
how is any of this legal?

396
00:33:05,194 --> 00:33:07,155
Well, lucky for us it is, so...

397
00:33:07,238 --> 00:33:10,116
This... This place is just
far enough outside of Hawkins.

398
00:33:10,199 --> 00:33:12,243
As long as we steer clear of main roads,

399
00:33:12,327 --> 00:33:15,663
we oughta be able to avoid
cops and, uh, angry hicks.

400
00:33:15,747 --> 00:33:17,665
If we're trying to avoid angry hicks,

401
00:33:17,749 --> 00:33:20,501
maybe we shouldn't go to some
store called the War Zone.

402
00:33:20,585 --> 00:33:23,338
Normally, I'd agree,
but we need the weapons.

403
00:33:23,421 --> 00:33:25,757
- So I think it's worth the risk.
- Me too.

404
00:33:25,840 --> 00:33:28,927
But is it worth the time? It'll
take all day to bike there and back.

405
00:33:29,010 --> 00:33:31,971
- Who said anything about bikes?
- You got some car we don't know about?

406
00:33:32,055 --> 00:33:34,557
It's not exactly a car, Steve.

407
00:33:35,266 --> 00:33:36,267
And it's not exactly mine,

408
00:33:36,351 --> 00:33:38,728
but, uh... it'll do.

409
00:33:39,729 --> 00:33:44,567
Hey, Red, uh, you got a ski mask
or a bandanna, something like that?

410
00:34:22,647 --> 00:34:23,982
That was suffocating.

411
00:34:25,608 --> 00:34:26,608
Go! Come on.

412
00:34:39,414 --> 00:34:41,165
Where'd you learn how to do this?

413
00:34:41,249 --> 00:34:43,171
Well, when the other dads
were teaching their kids

414
00:34:43,172 --> 00:34:45,169
how to fish or play ball,

415
00:34:45,253 --> 00:34:47,839
my old man was teaching
me how to hot-wire.

416
00:34:47,922 --> 00:34:52,260
Now, I swore to myself I
wouldn't wind up like he did,

417
00:34:52,343 --> 00:34:54,971
but now I'm wanted for murder,

418
00:34:55,054 --> 00:34:56,848
and soon, grand theft auto.

419
00:34:56,931 --> 00:34:59,767
So, uh, I'm really living
up to that Munson name.

420
00:34:59,851 --> 00:35:03,146
Eddie, I'm not sure I love
the idea of you driving.

421
00:35:03,229 --> 00:35:06,441
Oh, I'm just starting this
sucker. Harrington's got her.

422
00:35:06,524 --> 00:35:07,775
Don't ya, big boy?

423
00:35:11,279 --> 00:35:12,572
What the hell?

424
00:35:12,655 --> 00:35:14,198
Hey! Open this door!

425
00:35:14,282 --> 00:35:17,076
- Hey!
- They locked the door!

426
00:35:17,160 --> 00:35:18,161
Shit! Go.

427
00:35:19,287 --> 00:35:21,789
It's just a car. Everybody,
hang on to something!

428
00:35:21,873 --> 00:35:23,374
Oh my God! Let's go! Let's go!

429
00:35:23,458 --> 00:35:25,418
Drive, Steve! Drive!

430
00:35:25,501 --> 00:35:26,711
Go, go, go!

431
00:35:31,257 --> 00:35:33,342
Go! Go! Go! Go! Go! Go! Go!

432
00:35:33,426 --> 00:35:34,802
Shit, they look pissed.

433
00:35:34,886 --> 00:35:38,097
It's not every day you lose your
house and car in one fell swoop.

434
00:35:40,016 --> 00:35:41,225
Hold on! Hold on!

435
00:35:46,856 --> 00:35:47,857
Them!

436
00:35:47,940 --> 00:35:50,193
Stop 'em! God bless it!

437
00:35:50,276 --> 00:35:51,527
Okay.

438
00:36:18,179 --> 00:36:21,057
My friends. I saw them.
You told me they were safe.

439
00:36:21,140 --> 00:36:23,684
- They are not safe.
- Whoa, whoa, whoa, okay.

440
00:36:23,768 --> 00:36:25,770
Uh, just give us a second, please.

441
00:36:26,687 --> 00:36:27,687
Please.

442
00:36:28,898 --> 00:36:31,067
Okay, okay, first... first things first.

443
00:36:31,150 --> 00:36:33,861
We're not gonna let anything
happen to your friends, okay, kiddo?

444
00:36:33,945 --> 00:36:35,905
I will personally make sure of that.

445
00:36:36,489 --> 00:36:38,616
Did... Did you see where they were?

446
00:36:39,450 --> 00:36:41,452
They were at... They
were at Max's house.

447
00:36:41,536 --> 00:36:43,287
They're planning to kill him.

448
00:36:43,371 --> 00:36:44,413
To kill Henry.

449
00:36:44,497 --> 00:36:46,499
Okay. Okay.

450
00:36:47,333 --> 00:36:49,377
This... Does this Max have a last name?

451
00:36:50,086 --> 00:36:52,046
Max... Max Mayfield.

452
00:36:52,130 --> 00:36:53,965
Okay. So here's what's gonna happen.

453
00:36:54,048 --> 00:36:58,010
I have people in Hawkins, and I'm
gonna send some to Max Mayfield.

454
00:36:58,094 --> 00:36:59,846
- And they will stop him...
- Her.

455
00:36:59,929 --> 00:37:02,223
Stop her. And the rest of them

456
00:37:02,306 --> 00:37:04,767
from whatever foolish, although
well-intentioned, mission

457
00:37:04,851 --> 00:37:06,144
that they're attempting, all right?

458
00:37:06,227 --> 00:37:08,604
No. No, do not send your men.

459
00:37:08,688 --> 00:37:09,688
Send me.

460
00:37:09,689 --> 00:37:12,984
Your friends are not prepared
for this fight, Eleven.

461
00:37:14,277 --> 00:37:15,278
And neither are you.

462
00:37:17,071 --> 00:37:18,447
You must understand,

463
00:37:18,531 --> 00:37:21,284
when One kills, he doesn't simply kill.

464
00:37:21,909 --> 00:37:23,119
He consumes.

465
00:37:24,078 --> 00:37:25,997
He takes everything from his victims.

466
00:37:26,080 --> 00:37:28,708
Everything they are and
everything they ever will be.

467
00:37:29,208 --> 00:37:31,335
Their memories, their abilities.

468
00:37:32,670 --> 00:37:36,674
And we do not know where
he's been these lost years.

469
00:37:37,466 --> 00:37:39,927
But if he has survived this long,

470
00:37:40,011 --> 00:37:41,011
we can only assume

471
00:37:41,012 --> 00:37:43,514
that he has grown in strength.

472
00:37:45,349 --> 00:37:46,851
To underestimate him,

473
00:37:47,351 --> 00:37:48,769
to act rashly,

474
00:37:49,353 --> 00:37:50,605
would be very dangerous.

475
00:37:54,233 --> 00:37:56,485
I don't want to upset you, Eleven.

476
00:37:56,569 --> 00:37:59,363
What you've accomplished is
nothing short of a miracle.

477
00:38:01,782 --> 00:38:03,367
You came to me broken.

478
00:38:04,243 --> 00:38:06,204
And you've learned to walk again.

479
00:38:06,913 --> 00:38:08,706
But if you want to stop One,

480
00:38:09,207 --> 00:38:11,542
you will need to do more than walk.

481
00:38:11,626 --> 00:38:13,419
You will need to do more than run.

482
00:38:14,921 --> 00:38:16,464
You will need to fly.

483
00:38:17,632 --> 00:38:18,925
And you're not ready.

484
00:38:20,760 --> 00:38:22,345
My friends need me.

485
00:38:24,222 --> 00:38:26,057
I've stopped him once. I will again.

486
00:38:26,140 --> 00:38:27,934
I'm sorry. You can't.

487
00:38:28,434 --> 00:38:29,560
It's impossible.

488
00:38:29,644 --> 00:38:30,686
Nothing's impossible.

489
00:38:32,104 --> 00:38:34,670
I can call Stinson. She's
got connections at Nellis.

490
00:38:34,671 --> 00:38:35,700
That's two hours away.

491
00:38:35,983 --> 00:38:38,945
And if we hustle, I'll bet we can
be in Hawkins before nightfall.

492
00:38:39,028 --> 00:38:40,446
That would be a grave mistake.

493
00:38:40,529 --> 00:38:42,782
Waiting would be an
even greater mistake.

494
00:38:42,865 --> 00:38:44,200
What if One makes his move

495
00:38:44,283 --> 00:38:46,410
before we've had a
chance to throw a punch?

496
00:38:46,494 --> 00:38:48,037
Then what is the point of all this?

497
00:38:48,120 --> 00:38:50,122
That's a risk we're
going to have to take.

498
00:38:51,165 --> 00:38:53,334
We pushed her before
and look what happened.

499
00:38:53,417 --> 00:38:56,879
She lifted a 10,000-pound
tank into the goddamn air.

500
00:38:56,963 --> 00:38:58,839
You don't understand
what he's capable of!

501
00:38:58,923 --> 00:39:01,801
Maybe you're right. Or maybe
you are overestimating him.

502
00:39:01,884 --> 00:39:05,429
Either way, doesn't matter
because this is not our choice.

503
00:39:05,513 --> 00:39:07,598
We agreed this was
not gonna be a prison.

504
00:39:07,682 --> 00:39:08,933
We'll show her what this is,

505
00:39:09,016 --> 00:39:10,351
what we can offer,

506
00:39:10,434 --> 00:39:13,938
and then it is her choice
whether she wants to stay or go.

507
00:39:14,021 --> 00:39:15,021
Right, Doc?

508
00:39:16,232 --> 00:39:17,817
You may not agree with it,

509
00:39:17,900 --> 00:39:20,695
but here she is, standing before us,

510
00:39:21,487 --> 00:39:22,530
making a choice.

511
00:39:24,198 --> 00:39:26,200
You're sure you wanna do this?

512
00:39:29,453 --> 00:39:32,498
Okay. Pack your things,
say your goodbyes.

513
00:40:02,778 --> 00:40:05,781
- How's it handle?
- Not half bad.

514
00:40:06,615 --> 00:40:08,284
Considering that this is a...

515
00:40:09,618 --> 00:40:10,619
house.

516
00:40:10,703 --> 00:40:14,498
♪ Yesterday mornin' ♪
♪ They let me know you were gone... ♪

517
00:40:15,875 --> 00:40:16,917
Yeah, it's...

518
00:40:17,960 --> 00:40:20,629
it's silly, but I... I've actually...

519
00:40:21,714 --> 00:40:25,676
I always had this dream that I'd
have this really... really big family.

520
00:40:25,760 --> 00:40:27,261
I'm talking, like, uh,

521
00:40:27,345 --> 00:40:29,013
a full brood of Harringtons.

522
00:40:29,096 --> 00:40:30,639
Like, five, six kids.

523
00:40:30,723 --> 00:40:32,725
- Six?
- Yeah. Six little nuggets.

524
00:40:32,808 --> 00:40:34,435
Three girls, three boys.

525
00:40:36,145 --> 00:40:39,982
And... and every summer, I
figured all of us Harringtons,

526
00:40:40,066 --> 00:40:43,903
we would pack into something like this

527
00:40:43,986 --> 00:40:47,114
and... just see the country.

528
00:40:47,990 --> 00:40:50,534
You know, the Rockies, Grand Canyon,

529
00:40:50,618 --> 00:40:52,411
maybe Yellowstone.

530
00:40:53,662 --> 00:40:57,792
End up in some beachside
town in California.

531
00:40:57,875 --> 00:41:00,044
Spend a week parked in the sand.

532
00:41:02,922 --> 00:41:04,298
Learn how to surf or something.

533
00:41:06,050 --> 00:41:07,927
That sounds nice.

534
00:41:09,970 --> 00:41:10,970
Yeah?

535
00:41:11,389 --> 00:41:12,389
Yeah.

536
00:41:15,309 --> 00:41:18,062
Well, uh, except for the six-kid part.

537
00:41:18,145 --> 00:41:21,065
That sounds like a total nightmare.

538
00:41:21,148 --> 00:41:23,109
If only I had some practice.

539
00:41:24,318 --> 00:41:25,361
All right. Fair.

540
00:41:25,861 --> 00:41:27,613
That's fair.

541
00:41:28,280 --> 00:41:31,784
♪ Oh, I've seen fire
and I've seen rain ♪

542
00:41:34,203 --> 00:41:38,124
♪ I've seen sunny days ♪
♪ That I thought would never end ♪

543
00:41:40,292 --> 00:41:43,754
♪ I've seen lonely times ♪
♪ When I could not find a friend ♪

544
00:41:43,838 --> 00:41:44,838
Hey.

545
00:41:46,590 --> 00:41:48,968
♪ But I always thought ♪
♪ That I'd see you again... ♪

546
00:41:49,051 --> 00:41:50,302
So I've been thinking,

547
00:41:50,386 --> 00:41:54,223
two of the three of Vecna's victims
were seeing Ms. Kelley, right?

548
00:41:54,306 --> 00:41:55,641
- Yeah.
- Okay.

549
00:41:55,724 --> 00:41:57,875
So I figure there's a good chance

550
00:41:57,876 --> 00:41:59,562
Vecna cursed another
one of her students.

551
00:41:59,645 --> 00:42:02,940
We go back to her office.
We read all of her files.

552
00:42:03,023 --> 00:42:05,734
Look for mentions of headaches,
nosebleeds, nightmares.

553
00:42:05,818 --> 00:42:08,446
- We identify his most likely next victim.
- Lucas.

554
00:42:08,529 --> 00:42:10,156
- We stake out his house...
- Lucas, stop.

555
00:42:10,739 --> 00:42:12,825
We don't have time
for any of that, okay?

556
00:42:13,325 --> 00:42:14,452
And even if we did,

557
00:42:15,161 --> 00:42:17,413
even if your plan did work,

558
00:42:18,247 --> 00:42:20,833
we'd be putting a
total stranger at risk.

559
00:42:20,916 --> 00:42:23,294
A stranger who has no idea
what they're up against.

560
00:42:23,794 --> 00:42:24,794
I do.

561
00:42:26,005 --> 00:42:27,840
He uses my memories against me.

562
00:42:29,175 --> 00:42:32,261
But... only my darkest memories.

563
00:42:32,344 --> 00:42:35,598
- Same with Chrissy and Fred, right?
- Right.

564
00:42:35,681 --> 00:42:38,225
It's like he only sees
the darkness in us.

565
00:42:39,935 --> 00:42:43,564
So, I'll just run in
the opposite direction.

566
00:42:45,733 --> 00:42:46,734
Run to the light.

567
00:42:48,569 --> 00:42:50,946
And maybe he won't be
able to find me there.

568
00:42:52,114 --> 00:42:54,617
Now, how exactly do
you plan on doing this?

569
00:42:56,327 --> 00:42:57,327
I'm not sure.

570
00:42:59,788 --> 00:43:00,956
But it's my mind.

571
00:43:02,291 --> 00:43:03,334
Not his, right?

572
00:43:04,418 --> 00:43:06,754
So I should be able
to control where I am.

573
00:43:06,837 --> 00:43:09,840
I just need to... push him away.

574
00:43:10,966 --> 00:43:13,844
Find a happy memory and hide there.

575
00:43:15,721 --> 00:43:16,889
Hide in the light.

576
00:43:19,642 --> 00:43:21,644
You got a memory in mind?

577
00:43:23,979 --> 00:43:24,979
Yeah.

578
00:43:26,148 --> 00:43:27,525
It was a time when I was

579
00:43:28,776 --> 00:43:30,152
the happiest.

580
00:43:36,992 --> 00:43:39,995
Was I there?

581
00:43:42,831 --> 00:43:44,250
That's presumptuous of you.

582
00:43:46,252 --> 00:43:47,336
But yeah.

583
00:43:48,587 --> 00:43:49,797
You might've been there.

584
00:43:53,801 --> 00:43:55,761
Okay, but the second you start to lift,

585
00:43:56,720 --> 00:43:58,222
I'm calling in Kate Bush.

586
00:43:58,889 --> 00:44:00,432
- All right?
- Okay.

587
00:44:01,267 --> 00:44:03,269
- Deal.
- Deal.

588
00:44:37,261 --> 00:44:39,346
Heh, come on. This way.

589
00:44:41,640 --> 00:44:44,768
If I get a whiff of any
funny business, smuggler...

590
00:44:44,852 --> 00:44:46,645
I will not hesitate to kill you.

591
00:44:46,729 --> 00:44:50,024
In fact... I am just looking
for a reason. Understand?

592
00:44:50,107 --> 00:44:53,861
Are you a parrot, cop? You
keep repeating the same thing.

593
00:44:53,944 --> 00:44:57,072
You were trapped in a
cell with this dull man

594
00:44:57,156 --> 00:44:59,950
and you didn't take
opportunity to smother him.

595
00:45:12,046 --> 00:45:14,256
Beautiful, yes?

596
00:45:14,340 --> 00:45:16,800
Please tell me this
is another poor joke.

597
00:45:16,884 --> 00:45:20,679
You said you had a plane.

598
00:45:20,763 --> 00:45:22,556
- A plane!
- No, no, no.

599
00:45:22,640 --> 00:45:24,892
I... I told you I could fly you home.

600
00:45:25,392 --> 00:45:28,604
And Katinka can fly
you home, little bird.

601
00:45:28,687 --> 00:45:32,107
She was named Katinka
after my first lover.

602
00:45:32,191 --> 00:45:36,403
Katinka also had very
beautiful, very round buttocks.

603
00:45:36,487 --> 00:45:38,030
Uh, mu... much like this.

604
00:45:41,533 --> 00:45:44,036
This cannot fly us to America.

605
00:45:44,119 --> 00:45:45,287
Why not?

606
00:45:45,371 --> 00:45:47,539
As long as winds are not too strong

607
00:45:47,623 --> 00:45:51,293
and your military friends
do not shoot us out of sky,

608
00:45:51,377 --> 00:45:52,753
we can make it to the coast.

609
00:45:52,836 --> 00:45:54,797
There, while we refuel,

610
00:45:54,880 --> 00:45:57,716
we skin dip in ice-cold
water and wash off this muck.

611
00:45:57,800 --> 00:46:00,844
Then we fly her rest of the way.

612
00:46:00,928 --> 00:46:02,137
Happy ending.

613
00:46:02,221 --> 00:46:06,058
Okay, what is the furthest
Katinka has ever flown?

614
00:46:07,476 --> 00:46:10,437
For me, she is still a virgin.

615
00:46:11,230 --> 00:46:13,982
Uh, not real Katinka. Goodness, no.

616
00:46:16,276 --> 00:46:18,028
That Katinka, no.

617
00:46:18,112 --> 00:46:20,989
But this Katinka, pretty much unspoiled.

618
00:46:21,073 --> 00:46:24,993
But I'm sure she will
soar when given a chance.

619
00:46:25,077 --> 00:46:27,538
She just need little tune-up.

620
00:46:31,166 --> 00:46:33,711
- I did warn you, Jim.
- Okay.

621
00:46:33,794 --> 00:46:35,629
Should I shoot him now? Or later?

622
00:46:35,713 --> 00:46:37,131
What about Owens?

623
00:46:37,214 --> 00:46:42,177
He... He's gotta have contacts
or spies here that could help us.

624
00:46:42,261 --> 00:46:43,387
Can we do that?

625
00:46:44,555 --> 00:46:46,223
Can we make a call to the States?

626
00:46:56,984 --> 00:46:58,819
Yes, hello, miss.

627
00:46:59,361 --> 00:47:03,699
I'd like to place a call to the
United States. A very sick relative.

628
00:47:04,825 --> 00:47:06,744
Correct. Yes... The number is...

629
00:47:07,536 --> 00:47:10,080
- The number?
- It's 775...

630
00:47:10,164 --> 00:47:12,708
... 305...

631
00:47:12,791 --> 00:47:14,376
... 3450.

632
00:47:17,796 --> 00:47:18,797
Da, spasibo.

633
00:47:20,591 --> 00:47:24,094
- What are you doing?
- How exactly do you think this works?

634
00:47:24,178 --> 00:47:27,097
They will make the call for us,
and then they will call us back.

635
00:47:27,181 --> 00:47:28,557
How long's that gonna take?

636
00:47:29,850 --> 00:47:31,643
Five minutes. Five hours.

637
00:47:32,478 --> 00:47:33,812
Five days. Who knows?

638
00:47:34,980 --> 00:47:36,607
And when we do get the call,

639
00:47:36,690 --> 00:47:38,790
assume the KGB will
be on the other line,

640
00:47:38,791 --> 00:47:40,569
listening to everything you say.

641
00:47:40,652 --> 00:47:41,652
So,

642
00:47:42,529 --> 00:47:44,114
I suggest talking in code.

643
00:47:45,199 --> 00:47:46,408
Say the wrong thing

644
00:47:47,367 --> 00:47:50,078
and they will be on
us like flies on shit.

645
00:47:51,330 --> 00:47:53,040
Welcome to the Soviet Union.

646
00:48:15,145 --> 00:48:17,022
So much for avoiding angry hicks.

647
00:48:17,606 --> 00:48:19,358
Let's be... fast.

648
00:48:19,441 --> 00:48:20,901
- Yep.
- Definitely.

649
00:48:33,580 --> 00:48:36,250
- How many of these do you think we need?
- Five or six.

650
00:48:45,759 --> 00:48:47,678
What are you gonna do? Stand and gawk?

651
00:48:47,761 --> 00:48:48,761
Shut up.

652
00:48:50,347 --> 00:48:51,347
Ah!

653
00:48:52,349 --> 00:48:54,101
Jesus, you scared me.

654
00:48:54,184 --> 00:48:56,311
Whoa. You gonna mace me with that?

655
00:48:56,395 --> 00:48:58,522
If it keeps you in line, yeah.

656
00:49:05,779 --> 00:49:08,031
See? Not so scary.

657
00:49:17,165 --> 00:49:18,250
Robin. Robin!

658
00:49:19,710 --> 00:49:20,710
Who's that?

659
00:49:22,004 --> 00:49:23,130
Someone from band.

660
00:49:28,677 --> 00:49:29,677
How much is this?

661
00:49:29,720 --> 00:49:32,848
$120.99, but I'll throw in
20 rounds of buckshot for ya.

662
00:49:34,308 --> 00:49:37,811
Hey, can I see this
real pretty .357, please?

663
00:49:37,895 --> 00:49:40,397
Sure thing.

664
00:49:41,607 --> 00:49:43,734
- Here you go, son.
- Thank you.

665
00:49:47,696 --> 00:49:48,822
Nancy Wheeler.

666
00:49:53,076 --> 00:49:54,578
Wouldn't expect to find you here.

667
00:49:54,661 --> 00:49:59,082
Yeah, well, it's just... scary times.

668
00:50:04,212 --> 00:50:08,800
I'm... sorry about Chrissy.

669
00:50:13,847 --> 00:50:14,973
Want my advice?

670
00:50:16,308 --> 00:50:19,686
Shotguns are not good for much of
anything past killing small birds.

671
00:50:22,105 --> 00:50:23,899
I mean, they got power, sure,

672
00:50:24,399 --> 00:50:25,484
but not much range.

673
00:50:26,485 --> 00:50:29,655
And that's just gonna force
you into close-range combat,

674
00:50:29,738 --> 00:50:31,698
then someone can just grab
that barrel like this...

675
00:50:33,283 --> 00:50:34,409
... and redirect it.

676
00:50:46,338 --> 00:50:47,756
Well, you look nervous.

677
00:50:49,299 --> 00:50:50,299
Like I said,

678
00:50:52,052 --> 00:50:53,220
scary times.

679
00:50:56,765 --> 00:50:58,100
Now, your brother, he, uh...

680
00:51:00,185 --> 00:51:01,812
is he here with you, by chance?

681
00:51:02,396 --> 00:51:03,396
Mike?

682
00:51:03,897 --> 00:51:05,065
Mike.

683
00:51:05,732 --> 00:51:06,732
No.

684
00:51:07,401 --> 00:51:09,194
I only ask because he's...

685
00:51:11,321 --> 00:51:12,990
he's in Hellfire, isn't he?

686
00:51:14,324 --> 00:51:16,868
- I don't know what you're talking about.
- What about his friends?

687
00:51:17,995 --> 00:51:19,037
They here with you?

688
00:51:19,538 --> 00:51:20,998
Would you let go?

689
00:51:22,624 --> 00:51:24,960
Let go.

690
00:51:30,799 --> 00:51:32,509
What the hell is taking so long?

691
00:51:33,927 --> 00:51:35,220
- What happened?
- Gotta go.

692
00:51:35,303 --> 00:51:37,347
- Your old friends are here.
- Shit!

693
00:51:37,848 --> 00:51:40,809
- Let's go! Let's go!
- I'm going! I'm going! Sit down!

694
00:52:00,120 --> 00:52:01,705
Should be up on our right.

695
00:52:01,788 --> 00:52:03,331
There's nothing out here.

696
00:52:05,667 --> 00:52:07,419
Mmm. We there already?

697
00:52:07,502 --> 00:52:11,381
- Already? It's been nine hours.
- It's gotta be around here somewhere.

698
00:52:11,465 --> 00:52:13,216
What are we looking for, my dudes?

699
00:52:13,300 --> 00:52:16,094
- Some sort of facility.
- A fence. A building.

700
00:52:16,178 --> 00:52:17,804
Any signs of life would be nice.

701
00:52:17,888 --> 00:52:21,683
Since when did we decide Nina was
a building and not a small woman?

702
00:52:22,726 --> 00:52:24,269
Sounds like a small woman to me.

703
00:52:24,352 --> 00:52:25,729
It's not a small woman.

704
00:52:25,812 --> 00:52:28,106
Small woman out in this
desert would be hard to see.

705
00:52:28,190 --> 00:52:31,568
- How is he still high?
- Sure you got your measurements right?

706
00:52:31,651 --> 00:52:32,651
Yes, they're right.

707
00:52:32,694 --> 00:52:34,154
- You're 100%, right?
- Yes.

708
00:52:34,237 --> 00:52:36,323
Maybe latitude and longitude are wrong.

709
00:52:36,406 --> 00:52:39,576
- Are you really questioning Suzie?
- She's a genius, Jonathan.

710
00:52:39,659 --> 00:52:41,703
- Even geniuses make mistakes.
- Well, she didn't.

711
00:52:41,787 --> 00:52:45,207
If that small woman is small enough,
she could fit behind a small tree.

712
00:52:45,290 --> 00:52:46,333
Stop! Just...

713
00:52:49,836 --> 00:52:51,296
- Ouch.
- What are you doing?

714
00:52:51,379 --> 00:52:53,715
I am stopping us
before we get more lost.

715
00:52:55,801 --> 00:52:58,261
- Give me the coordinates.
- Um, okay.

716
00:52:58,345 --> 00:53:01,723
Longitude is 116 degrees,
five minutes, and 17...

717
00:53:01,807 --> 00:53:02,974
Slow down. Slow down.

718
00:53:05,352 --> 00:53:06,352
Nina!

719
00:53:09,439 --> 00:53:10,524
Nina.

720
00:53:12,317 --> 00:53:13,317
Nina?

721
00:53:15,445 --> 00:53:16,696
Nina!

722
00:53:24,412 --> 00:53:26,623
Holy macaroni.

723
00:53:26,706 --> 00:53:30,418
All right. You just go straight
down. Like, straight... straight...

724
00:53:33,880 --> 00:53:35,382
Right on the money, as I said.

725
00:53:35,465 --> 00:53:37,509
- It just doesn't make sense.
- Yo, dudes!

726
00:53:39,052 --> 00:53:40,637
My dudes!

727
00:53:40,720 --> 00:53:41,763
Jesus Christ.

728
00:53:41,847 --> 00:53:43,557
Come check this shit out!

729
00:53:43,640 --> 00:53:44,975
What is it?

730
00:53:45,058 --> 00:53:47,102
Gotta see it to believe it, my dudes!

731
00:53:48,353 --> 00:53:49,521
Come on! Hurry!

732
00:53:49,604 --> 00:53:52,315
Let's go! Let's go! Let's go! Pronto!

733
00:53:54,317 --> 00:53:55,360
Okay.

734
00:53:55,443 --> 00:53:57,320
So no small woman named Nina.

735
00:53:57,404 --> 00:54:00,240
But you said any signs
of life, am I right?

736
00:54:00,323 --> 00:54:02,241
- Right.
- Well,

737
00:54:03,702 --> 00:54:08,165
these are no regular
tire tracks, brochachos.

738
00:54:08,248 --> 00:54:10,500
I mean, look at the
tread on these monsters.

739
00:54:11,209 --> 00:54:13,920
They're fatties. And
you know what that means.

740
00:54:14,004 --> 00:54:15,004
Military.

741
00:54:15,422 --> 00:54:16,506
We gotta go.

742
00:54:57,005 --> 00:54:59,216
Well, I wouldn't do it if I
didn't think she was ready.

743
00:54:59,299 --> 00:55:02,052
But either way, I don't think
we have any other choice.

744
00:55:02,135 --> 00:55:03,470
- Do you?
- No, I don't.

745
00:55:03,553 --> 00:55:04,554
Yeah.

746
00:55:04,638 --> 00:55:07,265
- It might take me some time though.
- Just... As fast as you can.

747
00:55:07,349 --> 00:55:10,310
It's gonna take us two hours
to get to Nellis as it is.

748
00:55:10,393 --> 00:55:11,770
And, Ellen, one more favor.

749
00:55:11,853 --> 00:55:15,106
Can you send somebody over
to a Max Mayfield's house?

750
00:55:15,190 --> 00:55:18,193
There are some kids there that
just need looking after, okay?

751
00:55:18,276 --> 00:55:21,196
Ellen? Hello?

752
00:55:21,279 --> 00:55:22,739
Sam? Hello?

753
00:55:28,328 --> 00:55:29,871
Why the long face, Doc?

754
00:55:30,622 --> 00:55:31,831
We just wanna talk.

755
00:56:12,539 --> 00:56:13,539
No! Wait!

756
00:56:14,082 --> 00:56:15,083
No! No!

757
00:56:18,920 --> 00:56:19,920
What...

758
00:56:25,218 --> 00:56:26,928
You can't leave, Eleven.

759
00:56:33,226 --> 00:56:34,561
Where is Dr. Owens?

760
00:56:34,644 --> 00:56:36,646
Dr. Owens had a change of heart.

761
00:56:40,066 --> 00:56:41,568
I know you wish to go to him,

762
00:56:41,651 --> 00:56:44,279
and there's nothing I can do to stop you

763
00:56:44,362 --> 00:56:45,780
from forcing open that door.

764
00:56:46,990 --> 00:56:48,825
But if my men hear you coming,

765
00:56:49,701 --> 00:56:50,701
they will kill him.

766
00:56:54,414 --> 00:56:56,001
And alone, you will never find your way

767
00:56:56,002 --> 00:56:57,625
out of this desert to your friends.

768
00:56:58,835 --> 00:57:00,503
Here's what we're going to do.

769
00:57:01,421 --> 00:57:04,883
You and I are going to
complete our work together.

770
00:57:06,134 --> 00:57:08,470
And when I decide that you are ready,

771
00:57:08,553 --> 00:57:11,514
we will return to Hawkins, together.

772
00:57:12,098 --> 00:57:13,767
Papa and daughter.

773
00:57:15,643 --> 00:57:18,396
Why are you doing this?

774
00:57:19,147 --> 00:57:20,648
Because there's no other choice.

775
00:57:20,732 --> 00:57:21,941
There is a choice.

776
00:57:23,401 --> 00:57:24,819
Only one that is right.

777
00:57:26,363 --> 00:57:27,947
And you make the right choices?

778
00:57:28,656 --> 00:57:29,699
I try.

779
00:57:29,783 --> 00:57:32,118
Did you make the right choice with Mama?

780
00:57:32,202 --> 00:57:33,453
Four-fifty.

781
00:57:37,290 --> 00:57:38,875
Your mother was sick, Eleven.

782
00:57:39,542 --> 00:57:41,378
She was a danger to
herself and to others.

783
00:57:41,461 --> 00:57:44,214
She brought a gun into the
hospital. She killed a man.

784
00:57:44,297 --> 00:57:45,757
Hospital?

785
00:57:46,758 --> 00:57:47,758
No.

786
00:57:49,135 --> 00:57:50,220
A prison.

787
00:57:50,970 --> 00:57:53,890
Everything I have done
was for your own good.

788
00:57:53,973 --> 00:57:55,308
For your own protection.

789
00:57:56,059 --> 00:57:57,059
And Henry?

790
00:57:58,478 --> 00:58:01,064
You kept Henry in that lab.

791
00:58:01,147 --> 00:58:02,565
With the children.

792
00:58:02,649 --> 00:58:03,983
Was that for our good?

793
00:58:04,067 --> 00:58:05,777
Was that a right choice?

794
00:58:05,860 --> 00:58:08,405
I had no idea what Henry would do.

795
00:58:09,155 --> 00:58:10,407
I cared for you.

796
00:58:10,490 --> 00:58:12,617
I loved you. I loved all of you.

797
00:58:12,700 --> 00:58:13,701
Even Henry?

798
00:58:14,244 --> 00:58:15,244
Yes.

799
00:58:15,620 --> 00:58:19,124
I was trying to help Henry,
to understand him. Yes.

800
00:58:19,666 --> 00:58:21,418
Yes, I cared for him.

801
00:58:21,501 --> 00:58:25,046
Even after what... what he did?

802
00:58:25,713 --> 00:58:26,840
Yes.

803
00:58:26,923 --> 00:58:29,926
Because I knew I had failed him.

804
00:58:31,261 --> 00:58:32,512
So this morning,

805
00:58:33,263 --> 00:58:36,641
you said you believed he was
always alive in the darkness.

806
00:58:37,809 --> 00:58:40,311
Is that why I was
searching the darkness?

807
00:58:45,108 --> 00:58:47,110
Was I looking for him? For Henry?

808
00:58:47,944 --> 00:58:49,779
No. No.

809
00:58:50,530 --> 00:58:52,699
We were focused on the Soviets.

810
00:58:52,782 --> 00:58:53,782
You knew that.

811
00:58:53,783 --> 00:58:55,869
"Papa does not tell the truth."

812
00:58:56,703 --> 00:58:57,954
Henry said that.

813
00:58:58,705 --> 00:59:00,707
And now you trust Henry?

814
00:59:02,041 --> 00:59:04,919
Henry, who's manipulated
you like some puppet?

815
00:59:06,713 --> 00:59:10,216
You are the one who
released him from his prison.

816
00:59:12,093 --> 00:59:13,093
You.

817
00:59:14,345 --> 00:59:16,264
And now you are angry with yourself

818
00:59:16,347 --> 00:59:18,349
and you're taking your anger out on me

819
00:59:18,433 --> 00:59:19,934
and you're risking everything.

820
00:59:20,018 --> 00:59:21,018
No.

821
00:59:21,394 --> 00:59:22,520
No, you.

822
00:59:24,147 --> 00:59:25,857
You have risked everything!

823
00:59:25,940 --> 00:59:26,983
You have lied!

824
00:59:27,066 --> 00:59:28,485
You made me look for him!

825
00:59:34,032 --> 00:59:35,241
The gate.

826
00:59:37,494 --> 00:59:38,620
The Mind Flayer.

827
00:59:41,873 --> 00:59:42,957
So many dead.

828
00:59:45,835 --> 00:59:47,045
And all because of you.

829
00:59:47,128 --> 00:59:48,796
Because you could not stop.

830
00:59:48,880 --> 00:59:50,507
You could not let him go.

831
00:59:52,383 --> 00:59:55,803
I came here to try and
understand who I was.

832
00:59:58,306 --> 00:59:59,307
To see if I...

833
01:00:00,683 --> 01:00:02,101
if I was the monster.

834
01:00:06,064 --> 01:00:07,064
Papa!

835
01:00:08,316 --> 01:00:09,901
And now I know the truth.

836
01:00:12,153 --> 01:00:13,279
It is not me.

837
01:00:15,114 --> 01:00:16,199
It is you.

838
01:00:17,825 --> 01:00:18,826
You

839
01:00:19,994 --> 01:00:21,371
are the monster.

840
01:00:24,415 --> 01:00:26,417
I am going to open that door,

841
01:00:27,001 --> 01:00:28,503
and I am going to leave

842
01:00:29,587 --> 01:00:31,422
with Dr. Owens.

843
01:00:33,258 --> 01:00:35,593
If you try to stop me, I will kill you.

844
01:01:12,463 --> 01:01:14,257
You'll soon see the truth, Eleven.

845
01:01:25,727 --> 01:01:26,894
Ah!

846
01:01:53,713 --> 01:01:54,713
Is this legal?

847
01:01:56,215 --> 01:01:58,593
Actually, I think it's a felony.

848
01:01:59,510 --> 01:02:00,510
Right.

849
01:02:01,012 --> 01:02:02,764
But it guarantees one thing.

850
01:02:04,682 --> 01:02:06,059
I won't miss.

851
01:02:08,936 --> 01:02:11,773
- How's she feeling?
- Light. But durable.

852
01:02:13,066 --> 01:02:14,066
Deadly.

853
01:02:15,193 --> 01:02:16,861
But reliable.

854
01:02:17,820 --> 01:02:20,114
Hear me now.

855
01:02:20,907 --> 01:02:23,743
There will be no more retreating...

856
01:02:24,577 --> 01:02:27,163
from Eddie the Banished.

857
01:02:27,246 --> 01:02:29,499
Hey, you're really ready for bat-tle.

858
01:02:33,336 --> 01:02:34,336
You get it?

859
01:02:35,713 --> 01:02:36,713
"Bat-tle."

860
01:02:37,298 --> 01:02:38,298
B-A-T.

861
01:02:39,884 --> 01:02:41,386
No?

862
01:02:41,469 --> 01:02:42,679
I thought I had a good one.

863
01:02:44,430 --> 01:02:45,430
What are you doing?

864
01:02:46,349 --> 01:02:47,725
You son of a bitch!

865
01:02:50,520 --> 01:02:52,021
No wedgies! No wedgies!

866
01:02:52,730 --> 01:02:53,730
Never change,

867
01:02:54,565 --> 01:02:55,692
Dustin Henderson.

868
01:02:57,860 --> 01:02:58,860
Promise me?

869
01:03:00,863 --> 01:03:02,156
I wasn't planning on it.

870
01:03:04,033 --> 01:03:05,033
Good.

871
01:03:05,910 --> 01:03:07,328
- Good.
- Good.

872
01:03:07,412 --> 01:03:08,871
Hey, Sinclairs.

873
01:03:09,497 --> 01:03:12,125
How are those, uh...
those spears coming on?

874
01:03:14,168 --> 01:03:15,670
Flip that damn thumb around.

875
01:03:16,754 --> 01:03:17,754
What?

876
01:03:19,257 --> 01:03:21,217
It's too loose, Lucas.

877
01:03:21,300 --> 01:03:22,719
This isn't a basketball game

878
01:03:22,802 --> 01:03:25,430
where they blow the whistle
when your shoes fall off.

879
01:03:26,222 --> 01:03:28,015
Okay, okay, for the record,

880
01:03:28,099 --> 01:03:29,642
my shoes never fell off.

881
01:03:29,726 --> 01:03:31,185
Okay, for the record,

882
01:03:31,269 --> 01:03:33,004
it's kinda hard for
your shoes to fall off

883
01:03:33,005 --> 01:03:34,272
when you're riding the bench.

884
01:03:34,355 --> 01:03:36,232
Yet, for some reason,

885
01:03:36,315 --> 01:03:37,859
you show up to every game.

886
01:03:37,942 --> 01:03:39,861
Mmm, except the one that mattered.

887
01:03:39,944 --> 01:03:41,612
Plus, Mom and Dad forced me.

888
01:03:41,696 --> 01:03:44,574
Bull. Mom and Dad can't
force you to do shit.

889
01:03:44,657 --> 01:03:47,368
Well, even though you're
a bench-riding loser,

890
01:03:47,452 --> 01:03:48,786
you're still my brother.

891
01:03:49,287 --> 01:03:50,287
Just the facts.

892
01:03:53,624 --> 01:03:56,043
- It just doesn't make sense.
- What doesn't make sense?

893
01:03:56,127 --> 01:03:59,589
That was Dan Shelter. He
graduated, like, two years ago.

894
01:03:59,672 --> 01:04:01,716
- So?
- So he's in college.

895
01:04:01,799 --> 01:04:03,801
Which means he was
visiting on spring break.

896
01:04:03,885 --> 01:04:07,138
Fast Times was returned,
like, I don't know, a week ago?

897
01:04:07,221 --> 01:04:10,016
Right? Unless she's got some
horndog brother we don't know about.

898
01:04:10,099 --> 01:04:11,851
Which is possible.

899
01:04:11,934 --> 01:04:14,270
Or she's just really
into Judge Reinhold?

900
01:04:14,313 --> 01:04:15,313
- Steve.
- Nah.

901
01:04:15,313 --> 01:04:17,190
- What?
- I don't care.

902
01:04:17,273 --> 01:04:19,901
I don't understand why you do either
with everything that's going on.

903
01:04:19,984 --> 01:04:22,308
Honestly, this feels like a perfect time

904
01:04:22,309 --> 01:04:23,821
for that little pull
of the rug because...

905
01:04:24,864 --> 01:04:27,325
in the face of the world ending,
the stakes of my love life

906
01:04:27,408 --> 01:04:29,118
feel spectacularly low.

907
01:04:30,036 --> 01:04:32,663
Yeah. I mean, I get you there,

908
01:04:32,747 --> 01:04:35,333
but... I still have hope.

909
01:04:37,627 --> 01:04:41,214
- Not everything has a happy ending.
- Yeah, yeah, believe me, I know.

910
01:04:46,636 --> 01:04:49,013
I'm not talking about failed romance.

911
01:04:49,972 --> 01:04:50,972
I just...

912
01:04:51,724 --> 01:04:53,142
I have this terrible,

913
01:04:54,685 --> 01:04:56,229
gnawing feeling that...

914
01:04:58,981 --> 01:05:00,983
it might not work out for us this time.

915
01:05:02,193 --> 01:05:04,111
You think we shouldn't be doing this?

916
01:05:04,654 --> 01:05:08,241
I think we're mad fools,
the lot of us, but...

917
01:05:09,992 --> 01:05:12,745
... but if we don't stop him, who will?

918
01:05:18,668 --> 01:05:20,294
We have to try, right?

919
01:05:23,965 --> 01:05:25,049
Yeah.

920
01:05:29,220 --> 01:05:30,304
To killing Vecna.

921
01:05:33,891 --> 01:05:35,017
Slash Henry.

922
01:05:36,310 --> 01:05:38,312
Slash One.

923
01:05:55,371 --> 01:05:57,456
It's only a precaution, Eleven.

924
01:05:59,625 --> 01:06:01,460
I never intend to activate it.

925
01:06:04,922 --> 01:06:06,215
I very much hope

926
01:06:06,924 --> 01:06:08,926
our fighting has come to an end.

927
01:06:16,375 --> 01:06:17,435
Shh.

928
01:06:17,435 --> 01:06:19,437
Shh.

929
01:06:21,230 --> 01:06:22,315
I know.

930
01:06:22,398 --> 01:06:23,816
You're angry with me.

931
01:06:25,860 --> 01:06:27,361
But it was the only way.

932
01:06:30,781 --> 01:06:31,991
The best way.

933
01:06:41,709 --> 01:06:43,836
- What's going on?
- It's Sullivan.

934
01:06:44,545 --> 01:06:45,630
They found us.

935
01:06:55,556 --> 01:06:56,724
Go, go, go!

936
01:07:22,166 --> 01:07:24,877
Three! Two! One!

937
01:07:33,844 --> 01:07:35,930
- Go to the back!
- Get moving!

938
01:07:36,013 --> 01:07:37,098
- Move out!
- Go!

939
01:07:37,181 --> 01:07:38,808
- Get 'em out of here!
- No more time!

940
01:07:38,891 --> 01:07:39,934
Evacuate now!

941
01:08:01,288 --> 01:08:02,415
Move!

942
01:08:02,498 --> 01:08:04,208
Steady! Fire!

943
01:08:18,514 --> 01:08:19,849
Eleven, we have to go.

944
01:08:20,391 --> 01:08:22,852
- What is happening?
- They've come to kill you.

945
01:08:31,068 --> 01:08:33,487
Evacuate immediately. Please proceed...

946
01:08:43,247 --> 01:08:45,166
- Clear.
- Clear!

947
01:08:46,584 --> 01:08:49,336
Quarter and search by twos.
Hicks, take the upper level.

948
01:08:49,420 --> 01:08:50,420
Yes, sir.

949
01:09:09,356 --> 01:09:10,356
Sir?

950
01:09:11,484 --> 01:09:13,277
We found something
you're gonna wanna see.

951
01:09:18,115 --> 01:09:19,325
Well, well.

952
01:09:20,868 --> 01:09:22,078
And what happened here?

953
01:09:22,578 --> 01:09:23,578
Hmm?

954
01:09:24,580 --> 01:09:26,540
Are Mommy and Daddy fighting?

955
01:09:27,958 --> 01:09:28,958
Okay.

956
01:09:32,630 --> 01:09:34,340
Let's try this again, shall we?

957
01:09:37,760 --> 01:09:38,886
Where's the girl?

958
01:10:08,165 --> 01:10:09,792
Where do you think you're going, Doc?

959
01:10:17,800 --> 01:10:20,094
- Why don't you give 'em some lead?
- I got it.

960
01:10:35,943 --> 01:10:37,403
Down he goes.

961
01:11:02,178 --> 01:11:04,388
Victor-Two-Sierra, this
is Charlie-Lima-Golf.

962
01:11:04,471 --> 01:11:05,806
Do you copy, over?

963
01:11:06,390 --> 01:11:08,809
Victor-Two-Sierra, I copy, over.

964
01:11:08,893 --> 01:11:10,603
We've got the target in our sights.

965
01:11:10,686 --> 01:11:12,897
Requesting permission
to take the shot, over.

966
01:11:14,231 --> 01:11:16,025
Jack, you don't have to do this.

967
01:11:16,108 --> 01:11:17,109
It's over, Sam.

968
01:11:17,193 --> 01:11:19,778
Wait! Wait! Wait! I
can put her in a coma.

969
01:11:20,487 --> 01:11:22,156
A medically induced coma.

970
01:11:22,239 --> 01:11:24,366
We have the drugs. We
can do it right here.

971
01:11:24,450 --> 01:11:27,536
And we'll see if... if
these murders keep happening.

972
01:11:27,620 --> 01:11:30,664
If you're right, the killing ends,
and you can pull the plug on her.

973
01:11:30,748 --> 01:11:32,082
In fact, I'll do it myself.

974
01:11:32,166 --> 01:11:34,001
But if you're wrong about this,

975
01:11:34,793 --> 01:11:36,212
God, are we gonna need her.

976
01:11:36,795 --> 01:11:37,795
Jack.

977
01:11:38,923 --> 01:11:39,924
Don't do this.

978
01:11:40,507 --> 01:11:41,675
I'm begging you.

979
01:11:48,916 --> 01:11:49,934
Take it.

980
01:11:49,934 --> 01:11:51,185
You son of a bitch!

981
01:11:51,268 --> 01:11:53,437
No! You son of a bitch!

982
01:11:54,104 --> 01:11:55,564
Green light. Light her up.

983
01:12:00,444 --> 01:12:01,862
Civvies. Five o'clock.

984
01:12:04,949 --> 01:12:05,949
The hell?

985
01:12:05,950 --> 01:12:07,952
- There she is! There she is!
- Where?

986
01:12:08,035 --> 01:12:10,955
- On the ground!
- What are those dudes doing on the ground?

987
01:12:11,038 --> 01:12:12,498
- Is that blood, man?
- Shit.

988
01:12:14,291 --> 01:12:17,461
Victor-Two-Sierra, we've
got a civvy headed our way.

989
01:12:17,544 --> 01:12:20,089
Ignore it. Just take out the girl.

990
01:12:20,172 --> 01:12:22,466
Copy that. Ignore the
civvy. Take the shot.

991
01:12:30,099 --> 01:12:31,099
Found ya.

992
01:12:37,439 --> 01:12:40,651
- Hell are you doing? Hold her steady!
- I don't know, man. Something's wrong!

993
01:12:45,239 --> 01:12:46,239
Jesus Christ.

994
01:12:56,125 --> 01:12:57,125
Holy shit!

995
01:12:57,126 --> 01:12:58,377
Shit!

996
01:13:08,304 --> 01:13:09,304
I'm losing her!

997
01:13:13,934 --> 01:13:14,934
Shit!

998
01:13:21,608 --> 01:13:25,029
- Shit!
- Shit! I can't! I can't hold it!

999
01:13:42,588 --> 01:13:44,256
Shit! Shit! Shit!

1000
01:14:33,806 --> 01:14:34,973
Eleven!

1001
01:14:37,434 --> 01:14:38,477
Eleven.

1002
01:14:42,439 --> 01:14:43,482
Oh, Mike.

1003
01:14:51,532 --> 01:14:52,783
It's really you?

1004
01:14:53,492 --> 01:14:54,492
It's me.

1005
01:14:56,703 --> 01:14:57,746
- I'm here.
- Okay.

1006
01:14:58,497 --> 01:14:59,581
Everyone's here.

1007
01:15:13,887 --> 01:15:15,222
Shit. Shit. Shit.

1008
01:15:15,806 --> 01:15:16,806
Oh shit.

1009
01:15:17,349 --> 01:15:19,685
Oh shit. Oh shit. Oh shit. Shit!

1010
01:15:20,602 --> 01:15:21,603
Eleven.

1011
01:15:23,021 --> 01:15:24,106
You... Are you okay?

1012
01:15:25,274 --> 01:15:26,733
- I'm okay.
- Okay.

1013
01:15:27,860 --> 01:15:30,237
Hey, guys. We gotta go.

1014
01:15:31,447 --> 01:15:32,698
We gotta get you outta here.

1015
01:16:22,164 --> 01:16:23,165
Papa.

1016
01:16:24,708 --> 01:16:25,708
Eleven.

1017
01:16:31,924 --> 01:16:33,175
I want you to know

1018
01:16:34,259 --> 01:16:35,259
I'm proud of you.

1019
01:16:36,678 --> 01:16:37,888
So very proud.

1020
01:16:40,390 --> 01:16:41,433
You

1021
01:16:43,143 --> 01:16:44,353
are my family.

1022
01:16:48,982 --> 01:16:50,150
My child.

1023
01:17:02,454 --> 01:17:03,747
I've only ever

1024
01:17:04,623 --> 01:17:05,832
wanted to help you.

1025
01:17:07,709 --> 01:17:08,835
To protect you.

1026
01:17:13,090 --> 01:17:14,383
Everything I did,

1027
01:17:15,968 --> 01:17:17,052
I did for you.

1028
01:17:19,846 --> 01:17:21,682
I need you to understand.

1029
01:17:23,976 --> 01:17:25,894
Please tell me you understand.

1030
01:17:41,535 --> 01:17:42,536
Please.

1031
01:18:17,362 --> 01:18:18,572
Goodbye, Papa.

1032
01:19:46,410 --> 01:19:48,829
- We need to get to Hawkins.
- I know. And we will.

1033
01:19:48,912 --> 01:19:51,415
But we need to get you somewhere
safe. Gonna be people behind us.

1034
01:19:51,498 --> 01:19:53,333
No, Mike, we need to
get to Hawkins tonight.

1035
01:19:53,417 --> 01:19:55,627
We'll never make it.
That's over 2,000 miles.

1036
01:19:55,711 --> 01:19:56,920
We need to find a way.

1037
01:19:57,003 --> 01:19:59,131
If we don't, they are going to die.

1038
01:19:59,798 --> 01:20:00,882
Who's gonna die?

1039
01:20:02,592 --> 01:20:04,219
El, who's gonna die?

1040
01:22:16,060 --> 01:22:21,060
